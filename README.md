# Codepath_IOS101
Learning the fundamentals of iOS development, using Xcode and Swift languages.
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well
- I have added 3 labels and a button that changes the background color when clicked.

**3 of my Favorite Applications and 3 features**
- 1.Instagram, I love the AR feature for pages like TinydoorsAtl and also the algortithm
- 2.TikTok, I like the app for the simplicity and UI and also the algorithm.
- 3. Apple Music, I like this application because of how it integrates with apple devices and UI and ease of use.
  
**Application I would Like to develop or improve upon**
- I would like to develop an app similar to StockX or Goat, which mainly resells popular clothing and sneaker items.  with a more user friendly UI. I would also like to incorporate a feature that can authenticate the item beforehand using similar technology to Gold Goose brand or  Spatial labs. Taking a page from Craiglists, integrating a feature that allows for safe local meetups to buy and sell items.
